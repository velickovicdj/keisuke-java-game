# Project Keisuke - Programming I

*Author: Veličković Đorđe*

# Features:

  - Elements are styled and sitting nicely in the frame
  - The game is started by choosing to start with a new layout or to load layout
  - New layout provides the user with options to choose from:
        - Standard (5 by 5 playing field)
        - Endless (Playing field size increases as the user finishes the level)
        - Set size (Allows the user to set the playing field size)
        - Main menu
  - While playing the game, there are two buttons on the top left and top right:
        - Quit (Takes the user back to New layout page)
        - Options -> New layout (Gives the user the ability to start the new layout with a new (random) layout)
        - Options -> Replay (Gives the user the ability to restart the current layout)
        - Options -> Show solution (Shows the solution of the current layout)
        - Options -> Save layout (Gives the user the ability to save the layout of the current game to a file)

- Playing field is responsive, and always aligned to the center no matter the size of the field
- Smaller playing field size has fewer shaded cells, bigger has more
